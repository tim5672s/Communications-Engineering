# Communications-Engineering

This repository contains small examples and simulations of basics in communication engineering. The different folders contain examples of the different channel coding types:


##### Basic Channel coding:
- Simulation of a digital Transmission system (SIM)
- Digital signal representation (DBD)
- Digital baseband transmission (DBB)
- Channel coding Pt. 1 (KC1)
- Channel coding Pt. 2 (KC2)
